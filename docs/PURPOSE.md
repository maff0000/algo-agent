# Neuraeon Algorithmic Trading AI Agent – Purpose & Vision (v1.1)

The Neuraeon Algorithmic Trading AI Agent analyses global macro-economic,
sentiment, and asset-class data to identify repeating market patterns and
cycle-based opportunities.

It is designed for strategic and swing-horizon portfolio decisions rather
than intraday trading.  
The system learns from historic market data, discovering correlations between
economic indicators, sentiment shifts, and asset behaviour across time.

**Core Goals**

1. **Adaptive multi-asset intelligence** – new assets such as Gold, Silver,
   Energy ETFs, or Land REITs can be added dynamically.
2. **Cycle awareness** – integrates Armstrong-style macro-cycle analysis.
3. **Human-in-the-loop governance** – every model output is logged, auditable,
   and subject to manual approval.
4. **Security and compliance** – ISO 27001 / SOC 2 aligned, with separated
   data, logic, and interface layers.
